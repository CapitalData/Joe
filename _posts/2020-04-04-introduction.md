I spent the early portion of my career in Digital Media at CNET and then CBS Interactive. Created one of the first Yield/Revenue Management teams in digital media. Eventually became the VP of Revenue Management and Pricing for the entire organization.

In 2013, I was recruited by a former boss to start a SaaS and Internet-focused hedge fund, where Iâ€™ve spent most of the last seven years.
